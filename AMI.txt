EC2 instance Store 
EFS -> EC2 store system - n/w file system that can be mounted 100's of EC2
EFS works with linux EC2 instance in multi-AZ

Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance, but it is not an automated image management process service.

Which service can be used to automate image management processes? - EC2 Image Builder is an automated pipeline for the creation, maintenance, validation, sharing, and deployment of Linux or Windows images for use on AWS and on-premises.

You cannot use AMIs to add your IP addresses. IP addresses are added to an instance as you create it.

EBS Volumes can be attached to only one EC2 Instance, but EC2 Instances can have multiple EBS Volumes attached to them.

EBS Volumes allows instances' data to persist even after their termination.

EC2 Instance Stores are good to cache content.
