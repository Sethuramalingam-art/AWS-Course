Latency Routing Policy is used when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the region that provides the best latency.
Simple Routing Policy is used for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain, 
  for example, a web server that serves content for the example.com website.

  Weighted Routing Policy is used to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify.
