Databases Intro
Storing data on disk (EFS, EBS, EC2 instance store, S3) can have limits
somtimes you want ot store in databases
you can structure the data
you build indexes to effeicitenly query/ search through the data 
build the relataionships b/w our datasets

types of Databases
Relational Databases
no SQL Databases

Databases & shared responsibility on AWS
AWS offers use to manage different databases
benefits
Quick provisioning high availabilty vertical and horizantal scaling
automated backup restore oprationg and upgrades
monitoring and alreting

note: many databases tech's could be run on EC2 , but you must handle yourself the resiliency , backup, patching. high availabilty , fault tolernace,scaling...,


AWS RDS overview
RDS stands for relational Database service
it's managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language
it allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
Postgres
MySQL
MariaDB
Oracle
MS SQL server
Aurora(AWS Proprietary database)

Advantage over using RDS versus deploying  DB on EC2
RDS is a managed service
automated provisioning OS patching 
continous backups and restore to specific  timestamp
Monitoring dashboards
Read replicas for improved read performance
Multi AZ setup for Disater Recovery
Maninataence windows for upgrades
scaling upgrades, scaling capability  vertical and horizontal
storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io l)
But you can't SSH into your instances


RDS solution architecture
Elastic load blanacer -> EC2 -> (read/ write) -> Amazon RDS (SQL relational Database)


Aurora(AWS Proprietary database) -> not open sourced
Postgresql and MYSQL are both supported as Aurora DB
it storage grows incrment of 10 GB upto 128TB
Aurora costs more than RDS 20% more but is more efficient

Amazon Aurora Serverless
automated database insantiation and auto scaling based on actual stage
postgres and mysql are both supported as auroara serverless DB
no capacity planning needed
least management overhead
Pay per second, can be more cost effective


As usal we can create the RDS service in aws and we can choose which type of sql servers
mysql/ ms sql/ mariadb/ aurora

there is a option to take a db snapshot



once created RDS we need deployments 

RDS deployments: Read replica's, multi-AZ

Read replica's 
scale the read workload of your DB
Can create upto 15 read replicas
data is only written o mainDB

multi-AZ
Failover in case of AZ outage
Data is read/write only in main DB

multiregions also it will deployment


Elastic Cache overview
same way RDS is to get managed relational databases
Elastic cache is to get managed Redis or memcaches
caches are inmemory databases with high performances and low latencies
helps reduce load workoff databases for read intensive workloads
