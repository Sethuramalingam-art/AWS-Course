EC2 is one of the most popular offerings from AWS 

EC2  Elastic Compute Cloud  = Infrastructure as a Service

it mainly consists of 

Renting virtual machines (EC2)
Storing data on virtual devices (EBS)
Distributing load across machines (ELB)
Scaling the services using an auto scaling group (ASG)

Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how cloud works 


EC2 sizing and configuration options
OS => Linux or windows or MacOS
how much compute power and cores (CPU)
how much random access memory RAM
how much storage space 
N/w attched (EBS&EFS)
hardware (EC2 instance)
N/w card: speed of the card, public IP address
Firewall rules: security group
Bootstrap script : EC2 userdata


EC2 instance types:

t2.micro(1 vCPU, 1GB, EBS only) - aws free tier (up to 750hour pr month)
t2.xlarge(4 vCPU, 16GB, EBS only)
c5d.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 32GB, 1*400 NVMe SSD)

SSH keys are a pair of public and private keys that are used to authenticate 
and establish an encrypted communication channel between a client and a remote machine over the internet.

create key pair: 
keypair type - RSA
private key file format => windows 10 : .pem or .ppk
.pem => use with open SSH 


network settings: 
allow SSH traffic from
allow HTTP traffic from

configure EBS as simple 


there is userdata option for run at first time of instance launched

once launched there is there option to stop the instance because we have 750 hours free month. once you stopped hrs wont 
callculated by aws and they wont bill you. 

private ip wont change once launched but public ip may change
