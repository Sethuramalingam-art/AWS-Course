Intro of Security Groups -> EC2 instance


security groups work as firewall for EC@ instances
it regulate 
access to the ports
Authorised IP ranges - IPV4 and IPv6
Control of inbound network from other to the instance 
Control of outbound network from the instance to other


Good to know about security groups
Can be attched to multiple instances
locked down to a region / VPC  combination
Dose live in outside the EC2 - if traffic is blocked EC2 instance wont be see it 

it good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access 
if your app is not accessiable then it's a secuirty gtp issue
inbound traffic is blocked by default
outbound traffic is authorised by default
