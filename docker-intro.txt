A Docker container cannot consist of multiple images. A Docker container is an instance of a single Docker image. An image serves as a blueprint for creating containers, which are lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
However, a single Dockerfile can be used to create multiple images. The Dockerfile contains instructions for building an image, which can then be used to create one or more containers.
To build multiple images from one Dockerfile, you can run docker build for each build stage name you want to pick out of the Dockerfile (FROM alpine as name). By default, docker builds the image from the last command in the Dockerfile, however you can target the build to an intermediate layer.
You can also use multistage builds to keep Docker images small. A multistage build allows you to use multiple images to build a final product. In a multistage build, you have a single Dockerfile, but can define multiple images inside it to help build the final image.
