S3 advertised as infinite scaling storage
S3 -  Simple Storage Service
use cases:
backup and storage
disater recovery
archive
hybrid cloud storage
app hosting and media hosting
s/w delivery
static website


AWS S3 buckets store files in the name of objects 
it have unique name all over the region's

S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region 


Objects have a key
the key is full path
s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt
the key is composed of prefix + object name
/my_folder/another_folder - prefix
/my_file.txt - object name (file name)



Object values are the content of the body
max.Object size is 5TG (5000GB)
if uploading more than 5GB must be the multi upload

Metadata (list of text key/ value pairs)
Tags - useful for secuirty / life cycle
version ID

static web hositing -> enable it -> we need to add index.html -> now we can access 


AWS S3 versioning 

you can version your files in aws S3
it is enabled at the bucket level


AWS S3 - Replication (CRR & SRR)
S3 Bucket(eu-west-1) Source one region ===> (asyn replication) ===> S3 Bucket (us-east-2) Destination diff region
must enable versioning in source and destination buckets
Cross Region Replication CRR
Same Region Replication SRR
Buckets can be in diff AWS accounts
copying in async
must give proper IAM permissions to S3

use cases:
CRR - Compliance, lower latency access, replication across acc's
SRR - log aggragation, live replication b/w prod and test acc's


S3 Storage Classes
AWS S3 Standard - Gen Purpose

AWS S3 one zone - Infrequent Access
AWS S3 Glacier instant retrieval
