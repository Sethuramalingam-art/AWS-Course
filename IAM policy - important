IAM policy sturcture :

consists of 
version - version of policy language(default)
sid - identifier of policy
statement: one or more indivstatements

statement consists: 
sid : identifier of statement
effect : allow or deny -> whether the statement allows or denies access 
principal : account/user/role which this policy applied to
action: list of policy allows or denies-> S3: Getobject S3:putobject 
resource: list of resources to which the actions applied to


IAM password policy
password
MFA - Multi factor authentication 
Users have access to your account and can possibly change configurations  or delete resources in your AWS account.
So you want to protect your root accounts and IAM users
MFA - password you know + security device you own 

MFA authenticator device options
virtual MFA device  - we can able to set a device using assign MFA. 
Onced assinged MFA code, when we can login into aws console using the same user there is a mfa code option should asked in
login page.
google authenticator 

How the users can access the AWS?
1. AWS console -> password or MFA 
2. AWS CLI -> protected by access keys
3. AWS software developer kit -> protected by access keys

access keys are generated by aws console 
users manage their own access keys
Access keys are secret just like password
access key id = username
secret access key = password


there is an option in IAM -> under our profile -> secuirty tab -> create access key

once aws access key created=> 
open CLI =>
->aws cli configure
AWS access ID :
AWS secret access key: 
Default region name : 
DEfault ouput format : 

after configure
-> aws iam list-users
Users: [
{
details of user
}
]

AWS CLI 
A tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command -line shell
https://github.com/aws/aws-cli

cli command starts with aws => aws s3 cp myfile.txt
aws s3 ls


AWS software developer kit 
language specific api's
supports all the languages



installing aws cli in windows
there is step to install installer
=> after install 
aws --version 


instead of aws CLI => we have aws cloud shell to run aws cli commands
but it is available in limited regions

cli command => echo "test" > demo.txt => it will create demo text file with test text inside the file
cli command => cat demo.txt => test 


ROLES in IAM aws 
we can create the roles for aws services like EC2. Lamba
